# universal-keyboard-controller
This Arduino sketch converts serial commands into keyboard actions using the Keyboard library. It listens for commands starting with 'd' (down) or 'u' (up) followed by a key identifier. It supports single characters and special keys via a configurable mapping table for flexible USB keyboard control.
